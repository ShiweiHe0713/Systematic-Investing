# Pairs trading

Age 1: if a signal off, the end of the next day, to distinguish from the 0's, increment until hits the holding period

zfret 0 means good

## Signal logics

- If previous position was '1'(long), crossing longcap(exit), zdiff > longcap, 
- If previous position was '-1'(short), exit scap, get a flag of going
